Task

Given a plan of topics to study (which includes precedences) and Joca's willingness of shortening the study time according to the rules mentioned above, you should implement an algorithm computes the study plan per day and returns:
  the maximum number of topics that he has to study in a single day
  the number of days that he will be desperate, i.e. the number of topics to study in each of those days is more than the maximum he can handle.

Input

The first line contains three integers: the number of topics (m), the number of precedences (n) and the maximum number of topics that Jocas can study in a single day. Then, n lines follow. Each line has two integers, a and b, where a is the topic that must be studied before topic b.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of topics that Jocas has to study in a single day and the number of days that he will be desperate, in a single line.
